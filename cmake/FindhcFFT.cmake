# - Find hcFFT, HSA's hcFFT library

# This script defines the following variables:
# HCFFT_INCLUDE_DIRS    - Location of hcFFT's include directory.
# HCFFT_LIBRARIES       - Location of hcFFT's libraries
# HCFFT_FOUND           - True if hcFFT has been located
#
# If your hcFFT installation is not in a standard installation directory, you
# may provide a hint to where it may be found. Simply set the value HCFFT_ROOT
# to the directory containing 'include/hcfft.h" prior to calling this script.
#
# By default this script will attempt to find the 32-bit version of hcFFT.
# If you desire to use the 64-bit version instead, set
#   set_property(GLOBAL PROPERTY FIND_LIBRARY_USE_LIB64_PATHS ON)
# prior to calling this script.
